# **Transaction Harbor**

Transaction Harbor is a web application designed to enhance the efficiency of **risk analysis processes** within financial institutions by automating the analysis of **transaction data**. Leveraging **Python** and data analysis libraries such as **Pandas**, the project seeks to automate the identification of **fraudulent activities** while saving time and resources. The proposed solution involves developing a system that automates the processing of transaction data, performs **risk calculations**, and **flags potentially fraudulent transactions**. By automating these processes, **risk analysts** can focus on investigating high-risk transactions and implementing proactive measures to mitigate fraud. Additionally, the integration of **Streamlit** enables the creation of **interactive dashboards** and **reports**, providing stakeholders with **real-time insights** into transaction trends and patterns.

## **Transactions Page**

This page facilitates detailed breakdowns and analysis of transaction data. Users can upload **CSV files** containing transaction records and specify parameters such as **filenames**, **customer names**, and **high-ticket thresholds** for analysis. Upon uploading, the app performs various calculations, offers functionalities such as **filtering transactions** based on specific criteria, **identifying high-value transactions**, and **detecting potential instances of suspicious behavior**. Moreover, users can download **Excel worksheets** containing **comprehensive data summaries** for further examination and reporting.

## **Charts Page**

This page offer users the functionality to explore their transaction data through the **Chart Maker** tool. With parameters such as **payment status**, **method**, **application**, and **country**, users can refine their analysis, while setting start and end dates allows for focused examination over specific time frames. Four visualization types—**Histogram**, **Box and Whiskers**, **Box Plot Sum**, and **Box Plot Count**—enable users to glean insights into transaction trends, counts, total amounts, and distribution across payment types. This empowers users to make informed decisions, detect anomalies, and enhance risk management within financial institutions.
